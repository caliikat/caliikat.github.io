                        <h4>Bio:</h4>
                        <h5>
                            Originally from Perris, CA, Kathryn Allen started her journey when she left home and moved to Atlanta, GA to attend Clark Atlanta University in the summer of 2000. She started her first two years of undergrad focusing on pre-med coursework in Biology and soon realized that she would rather work on a television show about a hospital than actually working in a real one. This discovery prompted her to transfer her studies to the Art Institute of Atlanta, where she earned her BFA in 2005 in Digital Media Production. <br><br>

                            While in school, Kathryn showed such great aptitude with understanding the various creative tools such as Adobe Products and other media creation software that during her matriculation, she was offered a job by the department head to be a teacher’s aide and digital aide in the media labs that she already spent late nights working on her own work. The experience of troubleshooting creative issues, both technical and in creative approach, led her down a path of creative and technical consultations as a service. <br><br>
                            
                            Kathryn is currently a remote digital scheduler for Outfront Media, specializing in digital outdoor advertising on Outfront’s national display inventory. Posting national content, advising others about dynamic campaigns and executing static and real time data advertising events is how she spends her current work days. <br><br>
                            
                            After college and before Outfront Media, Kathryn began freelancing as a media artist for various entertainment projects. After a short stint as a contractor for Turner Studios in 2007 as the Scenic Services Assistant, she became the Senior Coordinator for the Turner Creative Production Group. CPG was a full service, in-house, print and digital production team that services Turner Corporate and all entities including tbs, TCM, TNT, truTV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Turner Sports, CNN and HLN. In this role, she has proven her aptitude as a leader in a fast-paced workflow. <br><br>
                            
                            She was promoted to Digital Signage Operations Manager in 2009 for Turner's digital signage inventory. Attention to detail and organization is vital for publishing content that is seen by millions of people daily. She was responsible for signage maintenance and content management for all 10 of Turner's networks. While Providing specialized support to each network, she also consulted digital content strategies while curating client relationships and expectations. During her time at Turner, she built relationships with the Digital Operations team for CBS Outdoor. After the company converted into Outfront Media, she was offered her current role in 2015.<br><br>
                            
                            Kathryn has great initiatives for digital growth and looks forward to fantastic achievements in 2018. “Having great leadership allows me to also be a great leader and spread good energy in a high demand environment.” -Kathryn
